<br>
<div style="margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 10%">
	<p> The development of plastics began with using natural materials that had innate plastic properties. For example, natural rubber was modified by using hydrocarbon resins. Hydrocarbon resins modify the hardness and flexibility of rubber and affect the bondability of rubber and plastic.  In 1855, Alexander Parkes invented Parkensine, a precursor to celluloid, the first true synthetic plastic. Celluloid was invented by John Wesley and was made by applying heat and pressure to a mixture of cellulose nitrate and camphor. </p>

	<p> Polyvinyl chloride was polymerized between 1838-1872. The true plastic breakthrough came in 1907 when Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Bakelite, a phenolic resin, is made from carbolic acid (phenol) and formaldehyde. Once a bakelite product is formed, it will not change shape or melt under heat. The reaction between phenol and formaldehyde is under heat and pressure, or a condensation reaction, generally using a wood flour filler. Bakelite was the first mass-produced synthetic plastic. </p>

	<p> Polypropylene, discovered in 1999, has extensive physical properties and is derived from the monomer propylene. The properties of polypropylene make it an outstanding candidate for long-use applications. It is produced by polymerizing with propylene using a catalyst system. Propylene itself was synthesized by Ziegler and Natta in 1956. </p>

	<p> Polyethylene is the most produced plastic in the world. It is produced by the addition polymerization of ethane, naphtha, and gas oil. A variety of products ranging from grocery bags, shampoo bottles, children's toys, and even bulletproof vests are made up by this polymer. Polyethylene was discovered by accident in 1933, and has become the most ubiquitous plastic in the world. </p>
