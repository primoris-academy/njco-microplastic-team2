<p> <b> What Are Microplastics? </b> </p>

<p> Microplastics are plastics 5mm or less that pollute the environment. Microplastics are divided into two subgroups: primary and secondary. A third type of microplastic does exist, but it isn't generally recognized. Primary microplastics are plastic particles intentionally manufactured to be 5mm or less before entering the environment. Some examples are microbeads, capsules, or pellets. Secondary microplastics form when larger plastic products like plastic bags, bottles or fishing nets break down into smaller plastic pieces. The third type of microplastic comes from the use of an object that gives off small plastic particles. Tires, rubber-soled shoes, and fibers from machine washing synthetic clothes are all examples of this. 

<p> <b> How do Plastics Degrade into Microplastics? </b> </p>

<p>Plastics are polymers, and polymers can degrade. Polymer degradation is the physical or chemical change caused by the environment. </p>

<p> There are multiple types of polymer degradation. Thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation occurs occurs when the polymer is exposed to high temperatures, breaking the bonds between the monomers in what is known as scission. Abrasion from sand and stones on the seashore break the plastic down into microplastics in mechanical degradation. Biological degradation only occurs in small, isolated occurrences, as there is no large population of bacteria or fungi that can break the carbon links in plastic. Radiation absorbed by the plastic polymer also has the ability to break down bonds. </p>

<p> The breakdown of polymers in seawater occurs in multiple scission variants and side-group elimination. Random scission is the formation of free radicals situated sporadically along the polymer backbone. This can cause the bonds between the monomers to break. Chain scission also involves free radicals that form along the polymer but leave it with one saturated and free end. Side-group elimination is breakdown of the polymer with no additives. It is when the side groups get elimination, and this already weak molecule gets broken down further by scission. </p>

<p> These degradation processes only break the plastic down into microplastics, which prove to be a detriment to the welfare of marine life and humans. </p>

<p> <b> THE CURRENT STATE OF MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION </b> </p>

<p> <b> Effect on the Environment </b> </p>

<p> Microplastics have negative chemical impacts. Free-floating pollutants that wash out to sea, heavy metals for example, stay on the surface of the water for ocean animals to consume. Microplastics take up room in marine animals' stomachs meant for food and alter their feeding behaviors. Many of these aquatic animals, stomachs stuffed with plastic, eventually starve and die. </p>

<p> <b> Effect on Humans </b> </p>

<p> Microplastics not only affect the environment and marine life, they affect humans too. The fish and other sea creatures that unwittingly consume bits of plastic are often caught and killed, then served to eat. Research has been done to show that plastic is found in our food such as fish and shellfish. Researchers from the Medical University of Vienna and the Environment Agency Austria found that “every single stool sample tested positive for the presence of microplastic and up to nine different types of plastic types.” Most recently researchers also found plastic in water bottles, “Tests of 250 bottles from 11 bottled water brands revealed microplastics in 93 percent of the samples, with an average of 325 particles per 34 fluid ounces (1 liter) of water.”. If plastic consumption continues accordingly, humans could soon be ingesting a thousands of pieces of microplastic per year. </p>

<p> Humans are no longer safe from plastic pollution—from the water we drink, the food we eat, the clothing we wear, and even the air we breathe. </p>

<p> <b> POSED SOLUTIONS TO MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION </b> </p>

<p> Many cities and countries are pushing for single-use utensils to be banned, but removing these are only the tip of the iceberg. Finding other materials to replace plastic packaging and commonplace items would eliminate the need for such a surplus of plastic to be produced. One boutique in the U.K. is growing fungus into furniture, and the Department of Agriculture is exploring milk-film packaging to keep food fresh. Packaging films on food are not biodegradable, are weak oxygen barriers, and are believed to leak compounds into the food. Milk protein packaging films are food-safe, great oxygen barriers, and can even be eaten with the food. They also dissolve easily. Because milk pagaging is biodegradable and edible, it creates zero waste. Strawless in Seattle is a company that is working towards the microplastic solution while in Israel, researchers from Tel Aviv University are working towards the development of bioplastic polymers made of microorganisms that feed on seaweed. The result is a biodegradable polymer. It produces zero toxic waste and recycles into organic waste. Expanding upon and making these solutions widespread is essential to stop the rise of plastic pollution in its tracks. </p>
